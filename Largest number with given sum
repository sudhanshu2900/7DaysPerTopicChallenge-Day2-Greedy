PROBLEM: 
        Example 1: N = 5, S = 12
        Output: 93000

        Explanation: Sum of elements is 12. Largest possible 5 digit number is 93000 with sum 12.

        Example 2: N = 3, S = 29
        Output:-1

        Explanation: There is no such three digit number whose sum is 29.


APPROACH: The idea is to one by one fill all digits from leftmost to rightmost (or from most significant digit to least significant). 
          We compare the remaining sum with 9 if the remaining sum is more than 9, we put 9 at the current position, else we put the remaining sum. 
          Since we fill digits from left to right, we put the highest digits on the left side, hence get the largest number. 
          
          
          
SOLUTION:


string largestNumber(int n, int sum)
    {
        string ans="";
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(sum>=9){
                ans+=to_string(9);
                sum=sum-9;
            }
            else if(sum==0){
                ans+='0';
            }
            else{
                ans+=to_string(sum);
                sum=0;
            }
        }
        if(sum>0){
            return "-1";
        }
        else
            return ans;
    }
